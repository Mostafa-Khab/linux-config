# Linux relaxing configuration
- to start:- clone this repo and install necessary programs needed by the configuration files you want. 
- you may need to lookup the files you want to know the needed programs example: (oh-my-posh) 
- there is install.sh which you can run (sh install.sh) but you still need to install some programs to let the configs work properly. 
- WARNING: this install.sh copies blindly to the specified pathes. it may destroy you old configs if there. 
- NOTE: make sure to back up your configs to protect them (or use safe-install.sh as it don't overwrite anyfiles).
